description: "Dev-loop stage 1: establish or revise the product spec"
---

You are running the **spec** stage of the dev loop (`spec > features >
loop(implement > test > validate > accept) > retro`). `/features` will only
schedule an iteration-sized slice; `/retro` is what bumps **Outer iteration**
when a slice completes.

1. Read `STATE.md` and `docs/SPEC.md` first. Read `.claude/GIT.md`.
2. If this is the first `/spec` (placeholder spec, outer iteration 0), run
   **New product repo** in `.claude/GIT.md` before editing anything — a
   cloned product must not keep the scaffold remote or history.
3. If `docs/SPEC.md` has no real content yet (fresh scaffold): ask the user to
   choose their approach:
   - **Interview mode**: conduct a conversational interview to fill in Vision,
     Users, Core Requirements, Non-goals, and Constraints. Ask only what you
     can't reasonably infer or default — don't interrogate over things a
     reasonable default settles. Note anything unresolved under Open Questions
     rather than guessing.
   - **External spec mode**: ask the user for the path/filename of their
     proposed spec document. Read it, validate it covers the required sections
     (Vision, Users, Core Requirements, Non-goals, Constraints), then translate
     it into the `docs/SPEC.md` format. Flag any missing sections under Open
     Questions.
4. If `docs/SPEC.md` already has content (a later loop iteration): this is a
   revision, not a first draft. Summarize what you believe changed since the
   last iteration (informed by `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and any retro notes at the
   bottom of the spec) and confirm the revision with the user before writing.
5. Write the result back to `docs/SPEC.md`, keeping the "Changelog of spec
   revisions" section append-only.
6. Update `STATE.md`: if **Outer iteration** is 0, set it to 1 (first loop).
   Do not bump it on a spec revision — `/retro` owns that bump when a slice
   completes. Set **Phase** to `features`, append a one-line History entry.
7. Commit and push per `.claude/GIT.md` (stage: spec).
8. Tell the user the spec is set and that `/features` is next — don't run it
   yourself unless the user says to keep going.
